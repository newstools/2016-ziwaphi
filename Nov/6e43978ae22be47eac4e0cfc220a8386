The South African Communist Party (SACP) in Mpumalanga has blamed the murder of an ANC leader in Pienaar, Mbombela, on the failure of national police commissioners to release investigations outcomes on political killings in the province. ANC deputy branch chairperson in Ward 23, Michael Zane Phelembe was shot at his home last Friday, and died at hospital just few hours after his shooting. His friend, Themba Mpila, said prior his death, Phelembe had warned him about a hit list and that include both their names. The SACP is concerned that it is six years since the former National Commissioner of Police, Bheki Cele established a team of investigators from various provinces to investigate the political killings in the province. The mere fact that he appointed a team of investigators was a clear demonstration that he was equally concerned that the police in Mpumalanga were incapable of apprehending the killers, said SACP provincial secretary, Bonakele Majuba on Thursday. Majuba said Cele s removal dealt a blow to the release of the report because nothing has happened since then. Last year, the now suspended National Commissioner of Police, Riah Phiyega also promised her own investigation as to why no one is arrested for the political murders in the province. Six years later and two high-level investigations the report is kept under wraps is a clear indication that the lives of the people of Mpumalanga are cheap. We call on the new police commissioner to release the report on the political killings in Mpumalanga before more people are killed, said Majuba.
