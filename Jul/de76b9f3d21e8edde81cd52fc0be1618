The South African Communist Party (SACP) has noted and condemns in the strongest terms possible a fraudulent letter containing a forged signature of our General Secretary Comrade Blade Nzimande and faked characteristics of SACP symbols and letterhead. The fabricated letter, purporting that the SACP is reversing its decision to be not on the ballot across all municipalities, has been circulating in social and electronic media. The letter has most probably been used by the charlatans who created it to commit acts of identity theft and electoral fraud, claiming to be the SACP and/or its representatives or General Secretary. The SACP is campaigning for the victory of the African National Congress (ANC) as the leading component of our alliance in the 3 August local government elections and has taken decisive action against unauthorised use of its name with the Independent Electoral Commission. It has removed its name from the ballot in line with its constitution, discipline and political programme, including its standing ANC-led alliance electoral strategy. The SACP will further bring charges against any person engaging in identity theft and electoral fraud affecting its name or that of its officials or identity symbols or letterhead. The SACP wishes to publicly confirm that almost all individuals engaged in such fraudulent acts including at Alfred Nzo district municipality in the Eastern Cape are not its members! The SACP strictly reserves its rights and responsibilities in terms of its constitution, party discipline and political programme as well as in terms of the law! Issued by the SACP.
