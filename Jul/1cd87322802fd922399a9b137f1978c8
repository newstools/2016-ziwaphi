Chiwayo defies ANC decision to recall him Lassy Chiwayo was appointed as the executive mayor of Mbombela local municipality since 2008 after the removal of Justice Nsibande. In March 2010, the ANC Ehlanzeni region took a decision to recall him, just in time before the start of the FIFA 2010 World Cup. Chiwayo defied the decision and called a press conference. This was his statement.
