Happiness was the order of the day when three underprivileged families in the Nkomazi local municipality received their newly built houses and donations from the Department and concerned stakeholders as well as the business community during the second phase of events to celebrate Madiba s birthday in Mzinti yesterday. An 86-year old gogo Emma Mkhatuwa who lived in a one roomed dilapidated house was excited to be led into her new house with full furniture that was donated by one of the contractors. Mkhatuwa who depends on her pension fund for survival said that it had never occurred to her that she will one day ever live in a descent house. I am excited to be among the beneficiaries. I have been longing for a moment like this for years now, thanks God today you came to me. I thank the good teachings and the spirit of Ubuntu Tata Mandela taught you. He really must be happy in Heaven to see you continuing to do good for the less-privileged, said the excited Mkhatuwa mentioning that she will now live in peace. The contractor, Mr Michael Nesane, expressed himself a happy man to see the beneficiaries excited: I have never felt so much good in my life. To see such happy faces it really brings joy to my heart. To this day my company has been able to give back to 86 families in the form of donating furniture and some food parcels. I am excited and wish our communities can adopt the culture of giving out to the needy. Activities of the day unfolded with MEC Violet Siwela and Nkomazi Local Municipality Executive Mayor, Cllr Thulisile Khoza leading all delegates paint the house of Mr Elijah Sihlangu and that of a 72-year old Ms Ressa Nkomo. They made grocery donations and planted vegetable seeds to each of these houses. MEC Siwela reminded the community and her entourage of the great work Madiba has done for the country and globally, thus encouraged for everyone including well-off people to help contribute positively to the poor.
